        <h1>TEA we Offer</h1>
        <p>Rare and exceptional teas ... harvested at the end of the world 75 varieties of tea <br>There are different families of tea: exactly six. We will speak here only of the three best known. The distinction depends on the processing that is made of the tea leaf. The different tea-producing regions of the world have generally given their names to the tea they produce. This is particularly the case for Darjeeling, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Assam. </p>

               <h3>Black Tea</h3> 
               <p>Many people new to the world of tea are most familiar with black tea. You can find black tea in name-brand teabags at the grocery store like Lipton or Tetley. Popular breakfast blends like English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast are other examples of black tea. Black teas tend to be relatively high in caffeine, with about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. They brew up a dark, coppery color, and usually have a stronger, more robust flavor than other types of tea. </p>

               <h3>Green Tea</h3> 
               <p>Green tea is another type of tea made from the camellia sinensis plant. Green teas often brew up a light green or yellow color, and tend to have a lighter body and milder taste. They contain about half as much caffeine as black tea (about a quarter that of a cup of coffee.) Popular green teas include Gunpowder, Jasmine Yin Cloud, and Moroccan Mint.            </p>
